  {"q":"Snooping is best described as:","choices":["Looking over someone's shoulder","Capturing and analyzing network traffic","Pretending to be someone else","Flooding a server with requests"],"answer":1,"explain":"Snooping (sniffing) is intercepting network traffic with tools like packet analyzers."},
  {"q":"What is dumpster diving?","choices":["Spamming with junk mail","Looking through discarded material for sensitive information","Intercepting network traffic","Encrypting a hard drive"],"answer":1,"explain":"Dumpster diving is sifting through trash for information like account numbers or files."},
  {"q":"Which attack secretly places a malicious entity between client and server?","choices":["Replay attack","On-path attack","Shoulder surfing","Rootkit"],"answer":1,"explain":"An on-path (man-in-the-middle) attack intercepts and relays communication."},
  {"q":"In a replay attack, the attacker:","choices":["Changes DNS records","Replays previously captured transmissions","Modifies files in a database","Installs spyware"],"answer":1,"explain":"Replay attacks reuse captured authentication messages or data transmissions."},
  {"q":"Which type of malware disguises itself as legitimate software?","choices":["Worm","Trojan Horse","Adware","Rootkit"],"answer":1,"explain":"Trojans masquerade as legitimate apps while carrying malicious code."},
  {"q":"Ransomware typically:","choices":["Steals Wi-Fi credentials","Encrypts files and demands payment","Disguises ads","Deletes log files only"],"answer":1,"explain":"Ransomware extorts victims by encrypting files until ransom is paid."},
  {"q":"What is spyware designed to do?","choices":["Crash the system","Display popups","Secretly collect user data and activity","Encrypt data for backup"],"answer":2,"explain":"Spyware hides on a system and secretly monitors activity."},
  {"q":"Which malware hides processes from the OS to give attackers persistent admin access?","choices":["Worm","Rootkit","Trojan","Adware"],"answer":1,"explain":"Rootkits conceal malicious activity by altering the OS at a deep level."},
  {"q":"Password-cracking brute force attacks succeed because:","choices":["They exploit expired certificates","They try every possible combination","They steal hashes from RAM","They sniff DNS traffic"],"answer":1,"explain":"Brute force systematically guesses all combinations until correct."},
  {"q":"Which authentication method requires at least two categories like 'something you know' and 'something you have'?","choices":["Single factor","Multifactor","Single sign-on","Biometric"],"answer":1,"explain":"Multifactor uses multiple categories of authentication for stronger security."},
  {"q":"Single sign-on (SSO) is:","choices":["Using one login to access multiple systems","Using many passwords for one app","A form of biometric authentication","An OS exploit"],"answer":0,"explain":"SSO lets users log in once and access multiple services."},
  {"q":"In access control, the principle of least privilege means:","choices":["Admins have access to all systems","Users get only the access necessary to do their job","Users can always escalate rights","Every account is equal"],"answer":1,"explain":"Least privilege minimizes permissions to reduce risk."},
  {"q":"Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is best used in:","choices":["Home networks","Government or military systems","Small peer-to-peer groups","Personal devices"],"answer":1,"explain":"MAC strictly enforces administrator-controlled labels, common in high security."},
  {"q":"Which access model lets users decide permissions for their own files?","choices":["Discretionary Access Control","Role-Based Access Control","Mandatory Access Control","Rule-Based Access Control"],"answer":0,"explain":"DAC allows resource owners to manage their own ACLs."},
  {"q":"RBAC assigns permissions based on:","choices":["Roles like job function or department","Network location","MAC addresses","Password complexity"],"answer":0,"explain":"RBAC groups users into roles with defined access rights."},
